# Project file structure
ðŸ‘‰ To use the ML platform, all models should be added to the ds-ml-models git repository as a dedicated project (sometimes referred to as a "_sub-project_" of the ds-ml-models repo.) directory which conforms to the following file structure:
```
ds-ml-models:
â‹®
|-> project directory:
    |-> production directory:
        |-> conda.yaml
        |-> model.py
        |-> __init__.py 
    |-> MLproject file
    â‹®
â‹®
```
